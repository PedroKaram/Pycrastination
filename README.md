# Pycrastination
This desktop app blocks websites of your choice to help you avoid procrastination.

## Requirements
<li>
  [Install Python]([url](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
</li>

## Usage
<li>
  <ol>Run CMD as administrator</ol>
  <ol>Navigate to the repository folder</ol>
  <ol>Run `python main.py`</ol>
</li>

## Disclaimer
The application **must be ran as administrator**; otherwise, it won't work.
YouTube and Instagram are blocked by default, if you want to remove one of them
or add more websites to the list, you'll need to open the source file on an IDE
such as VScode or Pycharm and modify the `blocked_websites` variable.
We're currently working on making Pycrastination more user-friendly.
